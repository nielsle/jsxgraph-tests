This project contains a few interactive webpages that I created with jsxgraph.

Each page allow the students examine a family of functions and try to guess how the constants determine the shape of the graph. Here is a list of functions

* [f(x) = a&middot;x+b](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/linear.html)
* [f(x) = a^x](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/exponential_simple.html)
* [f(x) = b&middot;a^x](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/exponential_with_prefactor.html)
* [f(x) = x^a](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/powerlaw_simple.html)
* [f(x) = b&middot;x^a](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/powerlaw_with_prefactor.html)
* [f(x) = a&middot;x^2+b&middot;x+c](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/quadratic_simple.html)
* [f(x) = a&middot;(x-p)^2+q](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/quadratic_with_toppoint.html)
* [f(x) = a&middot;(x-r)&middot;(x-s)](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/quadratic_with_roots.html)
* [f(x) = a&middot;x^2+b&middot;x+c and g(x)=b&middot;x+c](http://nielsle.github.com/jsxgraph-tests/functions/quadratic_with_tangent.html)

The webpages were designed to be compatible with the sections on eksperimental mathematics in the Danish math book system named "Gyldendals Gymnasiematematik".
