This project contains a few interactive webpages that I build using jsxgraph.

Each is meant to pose a riddle to the students. As an example the students could examine graphs of functions of the form f(x) = a*x+b and try to guess how the constants a and b determine the shape of the graph.

Later on they could examine the following functions

f(x) = a^x
f(x) = b*a^x
f(x) = x^a
f(x) = b*x^a
f(x) = a*x^2+b*x+c
f(x) = a*(x-p)^2+q
f(x) = a*(x-r)*(x-s)

The interactive website can be used in combination with the sections on eksperimental matematics in the Danish math book system named "Gyldendals Gymnasiematematik".

Jsxgraph is a wonderful toolkit to toy with. You should try it out yourself.
